## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy varied, but generally, I tended to overestimate the time required for tasks, especially at the beginning. This often led to feeling like I was behind schedule, even when I was progressing well.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, I became more realistic with my estimates, as I gained a better understanding of the typical time needed for each type of task. I also started breaking down tasks into smaller steps, which helped me make more accurate predictions.


### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of planning ahead and breaking tasks into smaller, manageable parts. Estimating time and effort accurately can help reduce stress and improve efficiency. I also learned that it's okay to revise estimates based on new information and experiences.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge of the subject, I would consider incorporating more interactive and real-world examples in the practical tasks. This would help students understand how the concepts apply in a broader context. I would also ensure that there is more time dedicated to debugging and troubleshooting, as these are crucial skills in software development.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I did well in staying organized and meeting deadlines for most practical tasks. I made sure to carefully read through the instructions and tackle each task step-by-step. I also consistently sought help when I encountered difficult problems, ensuring that I fully understood the concepts being taught.

# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Based on my reflections, I have focused more on breaking down problems into smaller, manageable tasks before jumping into coding. This has helped reduce errors and made debugging easier, as I can isolate issues in each step. Additionally, I have started planning more effectively by outlining my logic and approach on paper before implementing it in code.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to improve my time management by allocating specific blocks of time for each task and limiting distractions. I often spend too much time perfecting small details instead of progressing through the main tasks, so learning to focus on priority areas first is something I want to improve. I would also like to adopt a more proactive approach in seeking help when I encounter challenging problems.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have been diligent about attending lectures, and I actively engage in practical exercises, which has helped reinforce the concepts. Reviewing code and understanding examples has also strengthened my programming skills, so I will continue these habits. My consistency in completing exercises on time has been beneficial, so I plan to maintain that.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop overthinking small issues that don’t impact the overall program and avoid getting stuck in “perfectionism” with my code. Instead, I want to focus on building a working solution first, then iterating to improve it. I also realize I need to stop procrastinating on more challenging topics and tackle them sooner.


## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I suggest more real-world project simulations. It would be great to see more practical applications and examples of how we can use our coding skills in different fields.
